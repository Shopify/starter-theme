# How to contribute

We ❤️ pull requests. If you'd like to fix a bug, contribute a feature or just correct a typo, please feel free to do so, as long as you follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Shopify/starter-theme/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you're thinking of adding a big new feature, consider opening an issue first to discuss it to ensure it aligns to the direction of the project (and potentially save yourself some time!).

## Getting Started

To start working on the codebase, first fork the repo, then clone it:

```
git clone git@github.com:your-username/starter-theme.git
```

_Note: replace "your-username" with your GitHub handle_

Install all package dependencies and link local packages:

```
yarn install
```

Write some features!

## Documentation

If your change affects how people use the project (i.e. adding or removing
functionality, changing the return value of a function, etc),
please ensure the documentation is also updated to
reflect this.
